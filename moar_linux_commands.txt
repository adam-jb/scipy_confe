## tmux

Way of running multiple screens or processes in one terminal

>tmux new -s screen1

To create a new window in the current session, press Ctrl+B, and then C.


To hop between windows, press Ctrl+B, and then one of the followings keys:
-N: Display the next window.
-P: Display the previous window.
-0 to 9: Display a window numbered 0 to 9.

Can detach and attach sessions. Detached sessions keep running in background

If you press Ctrl+B, and then double quotation marks (“”), you split the window horizontally into two panes. Can do this more to get lots of CLI terminals for the same machine on one screen





date     # date

\$DATE   # \ escapes special character, so this would return '$DATE' and not point to the env variable DATE


[some command] &    # & causes the command to run in the background with a PID, keeping the terminal free 

fg %1       # bring a job that is running in background into the terminal (the ForeGround), where 1 is the PID in this case

fg %1        # pushes a job in the terminal back to the background

kill -s STOP 1444   # pauses execution of PID 1444

kill -s CONT 1444   # resumes execution of PID 1444

kill -s TERM 1444	# end process

kill -s KILL 1444	# force process to end
